## Program Specification
This program derives its data from a CSV file based on historical earthquake trends in July and August of 2016. The main driver plots the data onto a map using the following criteria:

- The map image (and turtle canvas) is 720x360 pixels, with (0,0) in the center. 
- Longitude (the x axis) goes from -180 to 180 and latitude (y axis) goes from -90 to 90, so (0,0) is in the center. 
- To get the canvas (x, y) coordinates based on a given (lon, lat) coordinate, multiply each coordinate by 2.
- Circles (plotted data) are sized based on magnitude and colored based on date (skyblue: July before the 29th, violet: July after the 29th, pink: August before the 9th, red: August before the 19th after the 9th, white: August before the 31st after the 19th).

## Turtle Graphics 
The circles are created using Python's turtle graphics and the turtle objectâ€™s circle method. The following is the output of the program utilizing turtle graphics to display the data in the CSV file:
